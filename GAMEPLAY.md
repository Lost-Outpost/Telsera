## Extra Info

### Starting Out

Curious to know what to expect? Here's a brief overview.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>

Hello! Welcome. Once you startup Skyrim via Telsera's MO2 instance and select New Game, you'll be prompted with the following message. This will determine if you want to play through the vanilla, default intro sequence. For the sake of this example, we'll skip it by selecting, "Yes."

![telsera-gotta-go-fast1](https://i.imgur.com/nUpmhH9.png)

You'll be greeted by the good ol' default Prisoner face right near the exit of the cave you escape from Helgen in. Feel free to customize your character to your liking by exploring the various available sliders. I went with my favorite preset (included in the list by default) for the following example images.

![telsera-gotta-go-fast2](https://i.imgur.com/4asgaBk.png)

After you've finalized your character and exited out of Racemenu via <kbd>R</kbd>, you will receive a pop-up asking who did you escape with. In vanilla Skyrim, you're prompted to make a choice between Hadvar (Imperials) and Ralof (Stormcloaks). This pop-up will give you the same selection, and the person you pick will be waiting for you outside of the cave.

![telsera-gotta-go-fast3](https://i.imgur.com/3uJWuBU.png)

Once you've exited the cave, the person who chose will be waiting outside. It's easy to miss, but notice the additional backpack on the ground. A collection of starter items will be inside for you to start your journey!

![telsera-gotta-go-fast4](https://i.imgur.com/3Bb8GtV.png)
  
</details>

### Difficulty and Survival Mode

Interested in changing the difficulty? Want to turn off Survival Mode? The spoiler below contains steps on how to adjust these settings to your liking.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>

Not feeling up to the current difficulty setting or additional gameplay mechanics? No worries, as playing on Adept is not required to be enabled to enjoy the pack, nor is enabling Survival Mode!

![telsera-starting-out1](https://i.imgur.com/Tzrz0Zy.png)

First and foremost we'll want to pause the game AFTER we've made our character. Automatically, we will be placed at the System page. Click on the Settings tab on the left.

![telsera-starting-out2](https://i.imgur.com/GjinTqV.png)

You will see two entries: the first saying Survival Mode, and the second saying Difficulty. Clicking the arrow in the LEFT direction will LOWER the difficulty, so the game will play easier. Clicking the arrow in the RIGHT direction will INCREASE the difficulty, making the game more challenging. After you decide on the difficulty you prefer, there will be an entry with a selection box that is **ticked (enabled) by default**. If you want to DISABLE Survival Mode, simply untick the box. Exit the menu by pressing the escape key, and you will be set.

![telsera-starting-out3](https://i.imgur.com/aQqkhex.png)
  
</details>

### TNG Customization

Want to change your character's private parts? There's a keybind for that! Under the spoiler you'll find some **IMPORTANT INFORMATION** you'll need to be aware of.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>

First, we'll want to press <kbd>K</kbd> to bring up The New Gentlemen's customization menu. It will pop-up regardless of what gender your character is. Telsera was designed to be friendly to a variety of bodies with different genitals. **PLEASE BE AWARE** that depending on what you pick, there are some **EXTRA STEPS** to prevent your character from turning invisible! 

![telsera-k-bind](https://i.imgur.com/NYPT5hY.png)

After you make your selection, a second pop-up window will appear. **Everything will work as intended when you pick a size for a penis!** If you chose to select one of the **vagina options** titled, "Vagina - X", then when you are in the second window prompting a size selection, **YOU MUST SELECT RESET SIZE!** If you do not select reset size, your character will turn invisible, except for their head. If you accidentally select a size and do turn invisible, all you have to do is press <kbd>K</kbd> again, select your vagina of choice, thennnn do reset size.

![telsera-reset-size](https://i.imgur.com/OdoRisy.png)
  
</details>

### OStim Romance

With OStim Romance, you'll now be able to dynamically initiate scenes to help increase your relationship with specific NPCs. However, you must be AT LEAST relationship rank 1 or higher to enable the dialogue in the first place! An example situation (first-time interaction) with Lucan at the Riverwood Trader can be shown below.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>

We'll use good ol' Lucan as our test subject. Once you arrive to his shop in Riverwood for the first time, you'll notice there will NOT be any dialogue regarding OStim Romance available. This is because our player character hasn't established any sort of connection yet, and are currently at level 0 relationship rank. We can change this by doing the associated questline with Lucan, aka [The Golden Claw](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Golden_Claw), by selecting the dialogue option, "Did something happen?"

![telsera-ostim1](https://i.imgur.com/vTAORHB.png)

For the sake of this example, I already went ahead and obtained the golden dragon claw key from Bleak Falls Barrow, and returned it to Lucan's possession. This in turn completes the quest, and increases the relationship rank between him and your character.

![telsera-ostim2](https://i.imgur.com/vRHlHNL.png)

If we try to talk to Lucan now that we're bud spuds, a new dialogue option will be appear titled, "Hey, do you have a moment?" This is one of the global indicator lines that we're ready to dive into OStim Romance!

![telsera-ostim3](https://i.imgur.com/baM49UT.png)

Before we start, you will run into a few pop-up messages explaining the gameplay settings you can pick to adjust the difficulty. Select whatever you'd like!

![telsera-ostim4](https://i.imgur.com/YKGFUK0.png)

After you've picked your preferences for your character's attractive and sociable scales, a series of options will appear. Depending on the level of connection you have with the NPC, actions will either fail or succeed. For this example we're start small by picking the (Chat) option.

![telsera-ostim5](https://i.imgur.com/HcdEbGy.png)

A new pop-up will occur reminding you that you can end said scene if you change your mind. In our case, the end key in Telsera is <kbd>Del</kbd>.

![telsera-ostim6](https://i.imgur.com/FrJ68rW.png)

The bars at the bottom left of the screen indicate the excitement factor for each NPC. Since they are just mingling, the bars will not go up. The camera will automatically zoom into free fly mode.

![telsera-ostim7](https://i.imgur.com/c8SZdJs.png)

The scene will end automatically after a few moments, and you will receive several messages describing how the interaction went.

![telsera-ostim8](https://i.imgur.com/6691EbT.png)

Depending on how strong your bond is with a specific NPC, the interactions involving more intimate gestures may fail. For this example, I reloaded to an earlier save where we had just given the golden claw back to Lucan (aka first encounter with him regarding OStim Romance). We're going to pick the (Seduce) option instead of (Chat).

![telsera-ostim9](https://i.imgur.com/AJCWqIV.png)

As you can see below, Lucan denied our seduction attempt, as our bond was not high enough. The more we talk to Lucien (ie. selecting "I'd like to ask you something..." or (Chat)) the more the bond will increase, and the other dialogue branches will be more successful. 

![telsera-ostim10](https://i.imgur.com/Ugu2GDm.png)

</details>

### OStim Romance Bypass

If you **DO NOT** want to go through the trouble of gradual intimacy via dialogue options and want to jump right into the fray, do not fret, there is an alternative route.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>

For this example, we'll stick with good ol' Lucan again. To initiate a scene with someone, simply be near them (or place your crosshair on them) and long hold the <kbd>-</kbd> key. Depending on the types of objects or furniture near by, you'll get a pop-up asking which specific one you would like to start the scene. I'll be selecting the Cooking Pot for the next few images.
  
![telsera-ostim11](https://i.imgur.com/YuuysBn.png)

The following message will ask about the position you'd like to be in. I selected Sub for this example.

![telsera-ostim12](https://i.imgur.com/NdJBaPy.png)

You'll then be able to navigate the controls of OStim's interface. You can now take it whatever direction you prefer (intimacy, kissing, etc.). Just a reminder, the keybinds by default for Telsera can be found in the [Configuration](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/Telsera/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md#OStim-Standalone) portion of the readme.

![telsera-ostim13](https://i.imgur.com/WdCdY0G.png)

After you've ended your time together via the <kbd>Del</kbd> key, depending on what actions were performed, you'll receive a message at the top left of your screen. This is an indication you character has a temporary buff Lover's Comfort.

![telsera-ostim14](https://i.imgur.com/IzhiZoj.png)
  
</details>

**EXTRA NOTE** - There is an Unrestricted Mode within OStim's MCM. Head down to the Debug entry, and tick the box "Unrestricted" to access a variety of animations regardless of your character's gender. Some clipping may occur depending on which animations you pick, but it's pretty handy nonetheless!

### Dragon Claws Auto-Unlock

Tired of manually doing the puzzles related to dragon claw keys? Steps on how to bypass this mechanic are below.
