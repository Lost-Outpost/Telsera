## Why isn't X mod included?

There are as many reasons a mod wouldn't be included in a list. Here are some of the most common ones. 

1. The list author didn't have enough storage space on their computer (most common).
2. The list author didn't know that mod existed.
3. It's incompatible with other mods in the list.
4. It's nonfunctional.
5. It has problems such as causing CTDs, infinite loading screens, and more.
6. It doesn't fit the list in question.
7. Something in the list already does what that mod does.
8. The list author doesn't like the mod.
9. It would require too much work to add for not enough benefit.
