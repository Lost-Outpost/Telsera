# Frequently asked questions

## When should I ping Foamimi on [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu)?

Only if you find a quality penguin meme. Any other situation is not acceptable. >:I

## Can I respec?

Yes, use the Draught of the Fate Unwound potion from [Ish's Respec Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960).

## Why isn't X mod included?

There are as many reasons a mod wouldn't be included in a list as there are stars in the sky. Here are some of the most common ones. Pick whichever one is applicable, or your favorite.

1. The list author didn't know that mod existed.
2. It's incompatible with other mods in the list.
3. It's nonfunctional.
4. It has problems such as causing CTDs, infinite loading screens, and more.
5. It doesn't fit the list in question.
6. Something in the list already does what that mod does.
7. The list author doesn't like the mod.
8. It would require too much work to add for not enough benefit.

If you're asking this question as a roundabout way of suggesting a mod, don't.

## Are there any issues I can expect with this pack?

As of now, the following issues are currently known:

  - Using Poison Spells or Poison-related FX with Rudy's ENB will occasionally cause the game to CTD. This is a finicky bug that not everybody experiences and is difficult to solve. The alternative ENB in the guide, Pi-Cho (Quality or Performance), does not run into this issue nearly as frequently as compared to Rudy's, so my only suggestion is to swap ENBs (untick ENBSeries - Rudy ENB and tick either ENBSeries - Pi-Cho ENB - Quality Version or the Performance variant).
