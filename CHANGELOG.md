# Changelog

## Will a save from version X be safe with version Y?

All modlists in the Animonculory use semantic versioning which translates to the following:

- 2.0.0.x are save game safe

- 2.0.x are save game safe

- 2.x.0 definitely requires a new save game

- x.0.0 definitely requires a new save game

# Version History

**NOTE** - The top-most entry is the current release.

## Version 1.2.0

  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>


### IMPORTANT

- This is NOT be a save-safe update. You will need to start a new game.
- There are new program requirements for the list. More information can be found [https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/Telsera/blob/main/README.md#installing-net-sdk-and-net-framework]{HERE}.
- Cheat mods have been re-added since I situated my compilation methods. Don't worry, they will be OFF by default.
