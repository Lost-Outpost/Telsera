# Changelog

## Will a save from version X be safe with version Y?

All modlists in the Animonculory use semantic versioning which translates to the following:

- 2.0.0.x are save game safe

- 2.0.x are save game safe

- 2.x.0 definitely requires a new save game

- x.0.0 definitely requires a new save game

# Version History

**NOTE - The top-most entry is the current release.**

## Version 2.0.0

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - click here to expand.</summary>


### IMPORTANT
 
- This is NOT a save-safe update.
- You will need to start a new game.

### Breakdown

I didn't keep a changelog because I was so back and forth on how much would change, but in the grand scheme of things, here's a few highlights:

- Addition of High Poly Head
- Addition of more locations from JK's Interiors series
- Addition of some singular new armor/gear sets
- Addition of Simple Bandit Expansion
- Addition of Sforzinda's Destinations to help with fast travel
- Updated both 3BA and HIMBO bodyslide presets the list uses (the 3BA one is brand new)
- Updated the vanilla player home setup the list uses from Cyn's work to TNF Skyrim House Remodel
- Updated the landscape textures the list uses (ie. Fantasia + Tomato's Landscapes AIO)
- Removal of Hammet's Dungeons 1 and 2, along with Lost Passages 
- Removal of some smaller, mod added creatures
- Various mod updates
- Various interior lighting updates (still using ELFX + ELFX Shadows)

Reasons typically consisted of:
- *Roswell from Animal Crossing New Horizons voice* Spaaaace. In the end, it wasn't much of a difference admittedly... but I spent a long time going back and forth on what to keep and what to axe. Trust me when I say it was a lot of finagling!
- Dungeons were repetitive, long, or just not interesting in certain cases.
- No longer interested in using certain mods.
- Flickering. Too dark. Inconsistent lighting. Ugh lighting in certain areas bugged me! Trying to fix some of that now before I run LODs.

Gameplay will be the same. Certain changes to NSFW animations to reduce the count a teeny bit to make room for new ones. And the overall feel for the list will be the same.
